**Comment**: The idea the author presented about 'culture' atomic note, and how she first capture it and search if it exist, if it exist she just add the new definition to it , otherwise she creates and new atomic note for it. Now I want to apply my own ABCs method on an idea I can add it to several permanent notes including "Zettelkastel" , now the deep understanding for this process will help much to understand Obsidian, PKM, Zettelkastel as well as my ABCs and how it helps in PKM. Let's do the process and get back to know my observation.

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-green">"Green is for claims the author makes that I agree with and that are relevant to work I‚Äôm doing, so these are usually quotes I will directly include in my own work. I tend to use this color more conservatively, so yellow is probably my most-used color."</mark>

**Comment**: It the same of my Yellow color where they are permanents or quotes, so I can use this define for my colors if I decide to use.

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-green">"So that‚Äôs my Zotero workflow. You can make folders or have one big folder for all your sources and use tags to search for sources, whatever floats your boat. I do a combo of both."</mark>

**Comment**: She called the highlighted with colors a Zotero workflow! should look to other researchers who do the same method?

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-green">"My Zotero and Obsidian aren‚Äôt synced automatically, which I honestly prefer because things can get messed up easily in that import process, so I like to be able to do them one at a time, so I can fix things in the template as they come up. For now it‚Äôs been pretty stable, so you should be able to use my exact template if you want."</mark>

**Comment**: She prefer not to do auto sync between Zotero and Obsidian

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For setting up the Obsidian side, I want to thank 3 fabulous youtubers for their videos on setting this up: morganeua (a fellow humanities PhD!), Bryan Jenks, and Danny Talks Tech, so there are some suggestions if you want to check out other people‚Äôs workflows. Morgan doesn‚Äôt do the sync that I do, but she has a lot of great videos on the Zettelkasten method, and I‚Äôve learned a lot from her videos. So Bryan Jenks and Danny Talks Tech do more of the syncing part, which is a little bit of coding in a language I wasn‚Äôt familiar with."</mark>

**Comment**: Need to add those to the people and networking folder

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-green">"The Highlightr plugin is great because you can set up your own custom highlight colors without having to find a theme that will let you do CSS, and you need this to make sure that your highlights are still highlighted when you bring annotations over from Zotero."</mark>

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-green">"The citekey in curly brackets is a variable that will be replaced by the Better BibTex name for each source. That name includes the last name of the first author, a short title and the date, so it makes the source easily searchable in your vault."</mark>

**Highlight**: <mark class="hltr-yellow">"It‚Äôs like the difference between building sandcastles that are projects that wash away after you complete them and building permanent architecture that stands for ages and can continue to be built upon."</mark>

**Comment**: Great Idea to differ between Ideas and notes gone after a paper, book or course finished and making a trust note-taking system that can save important notes as permanent knowledge that can be stay for ever to be used and developed in further projects . It could be added to zettelkastel permanent note
